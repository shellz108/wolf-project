	<h1>Gray Wolf Population</h1>
 <p>The global wolf <a href="https://github.com/shellz108/about-wolves/blob/master/index.html"><b>population</b></a> was estimated to be 300,000 in 2003 and is considered to be of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). <section>Wolves have a long history of interactions with humans, having been despised and hunted in most pastoral communities because of its attacks on livestock, while conversely being respected in some agrarian and hunter-gatherer societies.</section> <section>Although the fear of wolves exists in many human societies, the majority of recorded attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from rabies. <article><b>Wolf attacks on humans are rare because wolves are relatively few, live away from people, and have developed a fear of humans because of their experiences with hunters, ranchers, and shepherds.</b></article></section></p>
